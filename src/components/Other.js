									I have since February 2019 worked as a graphic designer at IT and management 
									consulting company, <a href="https://www.netlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Netlight</a>. 
									As a graphic designer I'm part of the design studio which is a self driven part of the company where we have
									the ownership. I consult clients about what 
									their vision is for a certain design and deliver to a deadline. In my 
									role I have gained knowledge about Netlight's graphic profile 
									and adapted my design aesthetics to suit it. I have also had the opportunity to onboard new team members and thereby
									trained my pedagogic skills. Through my work I have broadened my knowledge about 
									the Adobe suite, in particular Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and 
									InDesign.</p>
									<p>Some of the work that I've done at Netlight is presented in the image gallery.</p>

									KTHâ€™s student union paper, for four years where I did the

									as well as quite a few different editors in chiefs and art directors, since they have been

									I was part of <a href='https://studieresan.se/' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Studs</a> 2018/2019 which is a student driven 
									project course where we network with relevant companies in the tech industry 
									and end the course with a study trip. I was a member of the travel group, our responsibilities being 
									the planning and execution of the 2,5 weeks long trip for 30 engineering students to the USA. 
									The travel group consisted of five students and we did everything from researching cities, booking flights and 
									hotels as well as coming up with fun activities to do at each destination. On the trip we visited five cities in the
									USA: New York, New Orleans, Fraser in Rocky Mountains, Colorado and San Francisco.

									I was part of the reception at the Media Technology chapter for four years. The aim

									KPH whose main responsibility is to be a group leader taking care of the new students and be there if they have
